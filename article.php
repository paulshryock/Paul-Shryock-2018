						<p>Your business needs a new website that looks right on mobile devices, ranks high in search engines like Google, and gets more customers.</p>
						<h2>Mobile-Friendly</h2>
						<p>Your customers are using the web on mobile devices. They’re also on desktops and laptops, but mobile devices like phones and tablets are most common.</p>
						<p>A mobile-friendly website looks good on all devices and screen sizes. It loads fast—even on slower wifi and data connections.</p>
						<h2>Search Engine Optimized</h2>
						<p>Your customers aren’t finding your website. They’re searching the web for services and products that you sell, but your website is not showing up.</p>
						<p>A website that ranks highly on search engines is Search Engine Optimized (SEO). It shows up on page one of Google because it meets important SEO standards.</p>
						<h2>Gets More Customers</h2>
						<p>Most importantly, your website isn’t getting new customers. The people who see it are clicking away instead of converting. Or maybe your business doesn’t even have a website.</p>
